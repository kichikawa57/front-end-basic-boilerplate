### ✅ **Directory Structure Rules**

### **Overview**

The project's folder structure should be organized as follows:

```
.
├── [Page]
│   ├── template/
│   ├── style/
│   └── script/
├── data/
├── images/
├── script/
│   └── index.ts
├── shared/
│   ├── scripts/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── templates/
├── style/
│   └── index.scss
└── template/
    └── index.pug
```

---

### **Directory Details**

* **data/**

  * Contains **JSON data** referenced from each page's template (`.pug`).

* **images/**

  * Stores **image files** used across the entire project.

* **script/**

  * Contains **TypeScript files** used throughout the project.
  * Must include `index.ts`.

* **style/**

  * Contains **SCSS files** used throughout the project.
  * Must include `index.scss`.

* **template/**

  * Contains **Pug template files** used throughout the project.
  * Must include `index.pug`.

* **shared/**

  * Contains shared resources that affect the entire site.
  * `scripts/` - Shared **TypeScript files**
  * `styles/` - Shared **SCSS files**
  * `templates/` - Shared **Pug templates**

* **\[Page Name]/**

  * A directory created for each page.
  * Each page directory must include the following structure:

    * `template/` - Pug template
    * `style/` - SCSS file
    * `script/` - TypeScript file

  **Example:**

  * `about/`

    * `template/index.pug`
    * `style/index.scss`
    * `script/index.ts`

### ✅ **Best Practices**

* Each page directory **must include `index.ts`, `index.scss`, and `index.pug`**.
* Common resources should be placed in the `shared/` directory and imported into individual pages for reuse.
* The `data/` directory is designated **exclusively for JSON data**, which is dynamically imported into Pug templates.
* Image files should be centrally managed within the `images/` directory.
